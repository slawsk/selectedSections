The goal here is to put together selected Code and regulations for a tax class. To run the program, you will need to

1. Download the XML for 26 USC from http://uscode.house.gov/download/download.shtml
2. Download the relevant regulations in html from https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1 and, for the 301 regs, https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-301/subpart-ECFR5ffaf3310af6b61?toc=1

The output of this program will be an XML file (for the Code) and an HTML file (for the regs). You will need to convert those files to PDF and stitch them together.

When I create the selected sections for my course, I put an [edited table of contents for the whole IRC](https://github.com/slawsk/selectedSections/blob/main/TOCCodeEdited.pdf) and also the [up to date inflation adjusting Rev Proc](https://github.com/slawsk/selectedSections/blob/main/RevProc21-45.pdf) at the beginning - I've added those PDFs to this file too in case you want to use them.

Here's a [a sample of what the completed version could look like](https://github.com/slawsk/selectedSections/blob/main/SelectedCodeandRegSectionsFall2022.pdf).
