Sarah Lawsky / June 2023

This is the code underlying the [Code and Regs page](https://www.lawskypracticeproblems.org/codeandregs) of Lawsky Practice Problems. You can see a sample PDF on that page.

(To run this code, you will need to unzip the zipped RegDictionary in USC_26_New.)

The goal here is to put together selected Code and regulations for a tax class.

The problem I was trying to solve is that selected sections Internal Revenue Code and accompanying regulations are key reading for tax courses. There are four problems with commercial selected code and regs books. First, they are expensive: $100 or more for information that is freely available. Second, they are too long: they contain far more sections than any one class needs, because they are trying to meet the needs of a whole range of classes. Third, they are too short: it's very likely that any given professor will want to assign some sections that aren't in a commercially edited book. Fourth, they may go out of date quickly, as the law might change in any given year, and inflation adjustments do change year-to-year.

This program pulls exactly the Code and regulation sections and subsections you want. The notes at the end of the sections are automatically removed. You can give the students the opportunity to download the full PDF and/or upload it to a self-publishing website like Lulu.com to let them buy if for cost if they prefer a hard copy. Generate a new book for each semester, to stay up to date, and generate different books for different tax classes (basic tax v. partnership tax, etc.).
